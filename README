README:

The purpose of the version test was to show an understanding of git 
branches and version control. 

Master branch held the questions while the answers  branch held the 
answers. 

Also to write the principles of git clone, upstream etc in a form that
is understandable to myself. 


Upon reviewing early files after my initial training course. I have
deleted the 'answers branch' and merged back into master to tidy up
the mini project.
