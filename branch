What is a branch? 

This is the nuts (and bolts) of version control. 

If you are working on a project  and you wish to perhaps work on a new
feature or try a different method you can set up a new branch, in this
case we did 'answers' for the new branch. 
You can continue to add/commit in the new branch while leaving the original
version untouched on the master branch. 
You can switch between branches and work on 2 versions of the project, or
two or more developers could work on different branches. 
You can then merge the changes back into one branch, but you will have
to manually fix any conflicts. 
If you decide that the new branch is no good you can just revert back to the
original branch to continue with the 'old version'.
