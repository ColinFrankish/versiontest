What is upstream and what is it for? 

command git upstream 

It can be used in 2 ways. First to connect a new branch to the git hub 
so you can push the new branch into github. 
in this case git push--set-upstream origin answers

Or when you have forked a repo from somewhere else you can
create an upstream to the original repo by using
git remote add upstream 'URL of original repo from git hub'
This will allow you to pull from the original repo that you forked.
